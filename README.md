## Troubleshooting

- **Box sides not aligning?** Double-check that each side is flush with the base before screwing in.
- **Screws not securing tightly?** Consider using longer screws for a firmer hold.
- **Lid not fitting?** Ensure all sides are properly aligned; minor adjustments can help improve fit.

## Safety Information

- **Handle tools carefully** and avoid over-tightening screws, which can damage the material.
- **Wear protective gear** if using a drill or power tools.
